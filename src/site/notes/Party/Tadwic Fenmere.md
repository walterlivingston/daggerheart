## Background
Born and raised in the [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Fanewick/Verdenshade\|Verdenshade]], "Tad" is a father to 20 children. One of which was lost in the imperialist takeover of the [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Fanewick/Verdenshade\|Verdenshade]] by the [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Haven/Haven\|Haven]] military. In this takeover, the communities of the [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Fanewick/Verdenshade\|Verdenshade]] were taken into [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Haven/Haven\|Haven]]. Now living in the city limits for a number of years, "Tad" has felt his well of story material for his nightly stories is running a bit dry, so he has set out to reinvigorate his story telling with new adventures.

When in the [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Fanewick/Verdenshade\|Verdenshade]], "Tad" was a keeper of books and a member of the [[Lore/Factions/Listeners of the Unheard\|Speakers of the Unheard]]. Now that he has been forcibly adopted into [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Haven/Haven\|Haven]], he is working as an organizer of correspondence from [[Atlas/The Witherwild/Haven/Haven\|Haven]] outposts.
